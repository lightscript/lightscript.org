# lightscript.org

This is the source code for [lightscript.org](http://lightscript.org).

It is built with [gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby), a React static-site
framework, using LightScript.

If you're interested in seeing what LightScript looks like, any `.lsc` or `.lsx`
file in this repo should offer a decent example – 
[pages/docs/index.lsc](https://github.com/lightscript/lightscript.org/blob/master/pages/docs/index.lsc),
while a little messy, has a fair amount to see.

Note that, in general, this website was built with "ship it quickly" in mind,
and is not intended to be a paragon of perfect code.

The `docs` directory is the built content for github pages
(which requires this directory name).
